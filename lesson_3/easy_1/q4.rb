numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

What do the following method calls do (assume we reset numbers to the original array between method calls)?


numbers.delete_at(1)
  The arg that is being called upon `delete_at` dictates the index of the `numbers` array in which the indexed object is deleted. 

numbers.delete(1)
  THis means the `delete` the object being called from the array
