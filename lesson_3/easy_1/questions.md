Question 2
Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

what is != and where should you use it?
  It is a comparison operator, check to see if one object is not-equal to another.  
put ! before something, like !user_name
put ! after something, like words.uniq!
put ? before something
put ? after something
put !! before something, like !!user_name

When placed after a method invocation, `!` represents that the method is a destructive method. 

`!` represents that the method will return a boolean value.
